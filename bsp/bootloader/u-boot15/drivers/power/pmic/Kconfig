config DM_PMIC
	bool "Enable Driver Model for PMIC drivers (UCLASS_PMIC)"
	depends on DM
	---help---
	This config enables the driver-model PMIC support.
	UCLASS_PMIC - designed to provide an I/O interface for PMIC devices.
	For the multi-function PMIC devices, this can be used as parent I/O
	device for each IC's interface. Then, each children uses its parent
	for read/write. For detailed description, please refer to the files:
	- 'drivers/power/pmic/pmic-uclass.c'
	- 'include/power/pmic.h'

config PMIC_CHILDREN
	bool "Allow child devices for PMICs"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	default y
	---help---
	This allows PMICs to support child devices (such as regulators) in
	SPL. This adds quite a bit of code so if you are not using this
	feature you can turn it off. Most likely you should turn it on for
	U-Boot proper.

config SPL_PMIC_CHILDREN
	bool "Allow child devices for PMICs in SPL"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	default y
	---help---
	This allows PMICs to support child devices (such as regulators) in
	SPL. This adds quite a bit of code so if you are not using this
	feature you can turn it off. In this case you may need a 'back door'
	to call your regulator code (e.g. see rk8xx.c for direct functions
	for use in SPL).

config DM_PMIC_MAX77686
	bool "Enable Driver Model for PMIC MAX77686"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	---help---
	This config enables implementation of driver-model pmic uclass features
	for PMIC MAX77686. The driver implements read/write operations.

config DM_PMIC_SC2721
	bool "Enable Driver Model for PMIC SC2721"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	---help---
	This config enables implementation of driver-model pmic uclass features
	for PMIC SC2721. The driver implements read/write operations.

config DM_PMIC_SC2720
	bool "Enable Driver Model for PMIC SC2721"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	---help---
	This config enables implementation of driver-model pmic uclass features
	for PMIC SC2720. The driver implements read/write operations.

config DM_PMIC_SC2730
	bool "Enable Driver Model for PMIC SC2721"
	depends on DM_PMIC
	---help---
	This config enables implementation of driver-model pmic uclass features
	for PMIC SC2730. The driver implements read/write operations.

config DM_PMIC_SANDBOX
	bool "Enable Driver Model for emulated Sandbox PMIC "
	depends on DM_PMIC
	---help---
	Enable the driver for Sandbox PMIC emulation. The emulated PMIC device
	depends on two drivers:
	- sandbox PMIC I/O driver - implements dm pmic operations
	- sandbox PMIC i2c emul driver - emulates the PMIC's I2C transmission

	A detailed information can be found in header: '<power/sandbox_pmic.h>'

	The Sandbox PMIC info:
	* I/O interface:
	  - I2C chip address:       0x40
	  - first register address: 0x0
	  - register count:         0x10
	* Adjustable outputs:
	  - 2x LDO
	  - 2x BUCK
	  - Each, with a different operating conditions (header).
	* Reset values:
	  - set by i2c emul driver's probe() (defaults in header)
